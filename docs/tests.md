To run tests, do `pytest tests/` from the root of the project. To run a specific file with verbose output, do `pytest -v tests/test_dmatrix.py`.

I have some basic tests for dmatrix and pmatrix which are by no means rigurous, and are based on some code I saw in the original project, to make sure it can still run.
